//hash tables also known as hash map.
// used to store key-value pairs. keys are not in particular ordered.
//Fast: adding, removing & finding values.
//Every language has some sort of hash tables because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used.

//Inorder to lookup values by key, we need to convert keys into valid array indices. 
//A fucntion that performs this task is called hash function.

//Good Hash Function Qualities:
//1. fast (i.e constant time)
//2. doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes them uniformly.
//3. Deterministic (same input yeilds same output)

//There are many strategies for dealing with collisions, but most common:
//1. Separate Chaining
//2. Linear Probing

//Separate Chaining: with separate chaining, at each index in our array we store values using a more sophisticated data structure(e.g: array, linkedlist)

//Linear Probing: when we find a collision, we search through the array to find the next empty slot.
//Unlike separate chaining this allows us to store a single key-value pair at each index.

//Complexity: Θ(1)  Ω(1) O(n)
